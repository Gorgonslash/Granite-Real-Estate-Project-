  <h1 class="text-success"> Granite Real Estate Security Policy</h1>  
    <p>

        <b> Purpose </b> <br> 
        The purpose of the policy is to establish the goals and the vision for the breach response process. This policy will clearly define to whom it applies and under what circumstances, and it will include the definition of a breach, staff roles and responsibilities, standards and metrics (e.g., to enable prioritization of the incidents), as well as reporting, remediation, and feedback mechanisms. The policy shall be well publicized and made easily available to all personnel whose duties involve data privacy and security protection. <br>
        <br>
        Granite Real Estate's intentions for publishing a Data Breach Response Policy are to focus significant attention on data security and data security breaches and how Granite Real Estate's established culture of openness, trust and integrity should respond to such activity. Granite Real Estate's Information Security is committed to protecting Granite Real Estate's employees, partners, and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly. <br>
        <br>
        
                    
        <b> Scope </b> <br>
        This policy applies to all whom collect, access, maintain, distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle personally identifiable information. 
                      
        2.0 Policy Confirmed theft, data breach or exposure of Granite Real Estate's protected data or Granite Real Estate 's sensitive data
        
        As soon as a theft, data breach or exposure containing Granite Real Estate 's protected data or Granite Real Estate's sensitive data is identified, the process of removing all access to that resource will begin.
         
        The Owner/Executive Director will chair an incident response team to handle the breach or exposure. <br>
        
        The team will include members from: <br>
        •	IT Infrastructure <br>
        •	IT Applications <br>
        •	Finance (if applicable) <br>
        •	Legal <br>
        •	Communications <br>
        •	Member Services (if Member data is affected) <br>
        •	Human Resources <br>
        •	The affected unit or department that uses the involved system or output or whose data may have been breached or exposed <br>
        <br>
       <b> Confirmed theft, breach or exposure of Granite Real Estate's data </b> <br> 
        
        The Owner will be notified of the theft, breach or exposure. IT, along with the designated forensic team, will analyze the breach or exposure to determine the root cause. <br> <br>
        
       <b> Work with Forensic Investigators </b> <br>
        
        As provided by Granite Real Estate's cyber insurance, the insurer will need to provide access to forensic investigators and experts that will determine how the breach or exposure occurred; the types of data involved; the number of internal/external individuals and/or organizations impacted; and analyze the breach or exposure to determine the root cause.  <br> <br>
        
        <b> Develop a communication plan. </b> <br>
        
        Work with Granite Real Estate's communications, legal and human resource departments to decide how to communicate the breach to: a) internal employees, b) the public, and c) those directly affected. <br> <br>
        
        
        <b> Ownership and Responsibilities <br>
        Roles & Responsibilities: </b> <br>
        
        •	Sponsors - Sponsors are those members of the Granite Real Estate community that have primary responsibility for maintaining any particular information resource. Sponsors may be designated by any Granite Real Estate Executive in connection with their administrative responsibilities, or by the actual sponsorship, collection, development, or storage of information. <br>
        <br>
        •	Users include virtually all members of the Granite Real Estate community to the extent they have authorized access to information resources, and may include staff, trustees, contractors, consultants, interns, temporary employees and volunteers. <br>
        
        <br> <br>
       <b> Enforcement </b> <br>
        Any Granite Real Estate personnel found in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any third party partner company found in violation may have their network connection terminated. <br>
                   <br> <br>   
        <b> Definitions </b> <br>
